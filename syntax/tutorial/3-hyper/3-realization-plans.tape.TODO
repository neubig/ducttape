# TODO: Make this into a proper regression test and tutorial example

# Defining work plans to get more than just one-off experiments (this is intended primarily for config files)
# ducttape can be called with "ducttape -P Basics" to run cross products of branches by adding lines
# like the following to config files:
plan Basic {
  # 4 experiments/realizations: all combinations of small and medium
  # The * operator indicates a cross-product
  # The "score" indicates that score is the goal task ("target" in GNU Make lingo)
  # and only dependencies of that task should be run
  goal score: (whichTM: small medium) * (whichLM: small medium)
}

plan Viz {
  # 1 experiment/realization: just the large model
  # "score viz" indicates that those 2 tasks are the goal tasks
  goal score: (whichLM: large) * (whichLM: large)
}
